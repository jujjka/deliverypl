# DeliveryPlugin;

The simplest plugin for the so-called mail between two players. The first player opens the menu and drops the necessary items there, then these items are delivered to another player.
With the /trans send PLAYER_NAME command, the first player opens the menu, puts things together and sends. The second player takes immediately to the inventory with the command /trans get Sender_name;

Commands: 
  - /trans send Player_name;
  - /trans get sender_name;

Supports 4 languages:
 
    - Russian
    - English
    - Deutsch
    - Franz

When I have time, I will definitely add a database
